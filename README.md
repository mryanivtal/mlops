# Data Drift Detector 

This repository contains an implementation of a data drift detector, which can be used as an automatic step in a production pipeline, in order to detect drifts in Tabular datasets.

# Highlights:
- Automated statistical data drift detector module 
- Works on any tabular numerical data (Floats / Int / Categorical)
- Standard ML interface, easy to use (Create 🡪 fit 🡪 test)
- “Advanced mode” provides additional control:
  - Manual selection of statistical testers for features
  - Tester Sensitivity – using p-value
  - Tester Stability – repeated failures before alarm
- The module is extensible - very simple to add custom testers

# Implemented Data Drift Testers
- Univariate (Single feature) testers:
  - [Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test) – For numerical features
  - [Chi-Squared goodness of fit test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test) – For categorical  features
- Multivariate testers:
  - [KL Divergence test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) with calculated p-val for threshold over 5 runs
  - [Maximum Mean Discrepency test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test) (Kernel based) - Numerical implementation

# Getting started
Follow the example in the following notebook:

# Basic Usage
## How to fit a drift detector to a dataset

## How to test for drifts

# E2E examples
There are 2 notebooks that demonstrate a complete inference pipeline drift detection (xgboost regressor) on 2 tabular datasets:
The Boston Housing  and French Motor Claims datasets.
As part of the pipeline we injected drift to selected features, and show how the drift detector is alerts about them.
